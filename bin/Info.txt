Create a Project
There was an issue "no explicit encoding set"
I right clicked and did quick fix to UTF-8, it resolved

Download jar from "https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.mysql/mysql-connector-j"

Right Click -> Build Path -> Configure Build Path -> Libraries -> 
Module Path -> Add external Jar -> Apply and OK 

If I create project with module.java, then I need to add imports in that file, like require()
